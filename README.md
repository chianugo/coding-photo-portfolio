# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This site is the easiest way to view my coding and photography portfolios. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find:

## Coding Portfolio

In this section, you'll find a selection of projects I've worked on independently and in teams, from web development to mobile development to data analysis. Each project comes with a brief description, links to the live demo or repository where permissible, and any other relevant information, such as programming languages used and the size of the current user base.

## Photography Portfolio

In this section, you'll discover my passion for capturing candid portraits of friends and family and street photos taken on the move. A personally curated selection of my favorite photos is featured. Each image contains metadataâ€”name, date, and location.
